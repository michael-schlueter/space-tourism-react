# Space Tourism Website
> This responsive webpage displays information about space travel.



## General Information
- This is a project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3) which provided the design files for this project
- The aim of this project was to build a design as close as possible to the design files. [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) assisted in this by providing information about how to build and implement a design system in the accompanying [scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel)
- I took the project further by implementing my own design for the technology page. Furthermore I used React instead of plain JavaScript to handle the interactive elements of the page
- In order to boost my knowledge in using the new React Router v6 I used it for building the navigation of the site
- I also decided to use TypeScript to implement type-safety and get further practice using TypeScript in React applications



## Features
- Navigating through different pages
- Navigating through different tabs on the pages and dynamically displaying content and pictures
